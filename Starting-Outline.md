# Hackathon Startup Paper
## Objective
Create an interfacing driver between getting an input from a game (ex. agar.io) and output payouts based on placement and objectives done etc. etc.

## Considerations
* How much solidity can we grind through during the hackathon to complete this
* How much actual coding v. exploration is involved?
* How to deal with underlying factors such as gas
## Understanding what a smart contract is

https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/
* We need to learn how to use an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
* We need to learn how to use Solidity to a level proficient enough to complete the project
* We need an interfacing application to access a dummy ethereum wallet and browser
	* One example is meta-mask but we will need to understand if this has the functionality to let us test our driver on it
* Remix Browser IDE to code solidity? 

## Time-scale and division of work
* What is everyone's goal in this hackathon and can we achieve it through this project?
* What's everyone's availability to commit time to the project

## Timeline
* Consider adding agar.io heavily to craete more impactful presentation
